Net-Amazon-Cognito

This module is in the way of implementing the Amazon Cognito API 2014-06-30,
current as of 2014. It will be able to manage Cognito identity pools and
identities. Amazon states "Amazon Cognito is a simple user identity and data
synchronization service that helps you securely manage and synchronize app data
for your users across their mobile devices. You can create unique identities for
your users through a number of public login providers (Amazon, Facebook, and
Google) and also support unauthenticated guests. You can save app data locally
on usersâ€™ devices allowing your applications to work even when the devices are
offline. With Amazon Cognito, you can save any kind of data in the AWS Cloud,
such as app preferences or game state, without writing any backend code or
managing any infrastructure."
